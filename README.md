Setup screen [Tobii Eye Tracker 4C](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/tobii-eye-tracker-4c/) gazing information for [usability testing](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-breast-screening/wiki/User-Research#user-test-evaluations-) purpose. The [Tobii Eye Tracker 4C](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/tobii-eye-tracker-4c/) aims at providing an immersive reality without a headset. Also, with this product nothing stands between the screen and the immersive experience. Therfore, our clinicians will work with no interference of the device. This repository includes functions for the setup os the eye-tracking routines including: (i) calibration of the eye-tracker; (ii) finding eye positions; and (iii) validation of eye-tracker calibration settings. It contains functions for working with with the new [Tobii Pro SDK](https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/tobii-pro-sdk/) for [Python](http://developer.tobiipro.com/python.html), along with essential Eye-Tracking routines, in a `TobiiHelper` class.

The work is also based and higly contributed from the [`tobii_pro_wrapper`](https://github.com/oguayasa/tobii_pro_wrapper). The [`tobii_pro_wrapper`](https://github.com/oguayasa/tobii_pro_wrapper) repository was developed by [Olivia Guayasamin](http://collectivebehaviour.com/) ([oguayasa](https://github.com/oguayasa)) that we would like to thank. That repository shows pretty much everything we need to connect to a Tobii Eye-Tracker, calibrate the eyetracker, get gaze, eye, and time synchronization data from the eyetracker device, and convert the Tobii coordinate systems units.

To find out how to apply the [Upgrade Key](https://www.tobiipro.com/siteassets/tobii-pro/product-descriptions/tobii-pro-upgrade-key-product-description.pdf/?v=1.5) to a [Tobii Eye Tracker 4C](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/tobii-eye-tracker-4c/), follow the [Tobii Pro Upgrade Key â€“ User Instructions](https://www.tobiipro.com/siteassets/tobii-pro/user-manuals/tobii-pro-upgrade-key-user-instructions.pdf/?v=1.1) document. Nevertheless, the [Tobii Pro SDK Python API Documentation](http://devtobiipro.azurewebsites.net/tobii.research/python/reference/1.6.1.22-alpha-g9a43723/index.html) page is of chief importance to this repository, as well as, their [Examples](http://devtobiipro.azurewebsites.net/tobii.research/python/reference/1.6.1.22-alpha-g9a43723/examples.html) page for [Python](http://developer.tobiipro.com/python.html). For the first configurations, please follow both [Python - Getting started](http://developer.tobiipro.com/python/python-getting-started.html) and [Python - Step-by-step guide](http://developer.tobiipro.com/python/python-step-by-step-guide.html) pages, or follow the presented steps.
